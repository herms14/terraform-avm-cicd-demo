# 🚀 GitHub Repository Setup

## Repository Created and Ready to Push

Your Erdtree Self-Service Portal code is ready to be pushed to GitHub!

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/new) and create a new repository with these settings:

**Repository Details:**
- **Name**: `erdtree-self-service`
- **Description**: `Azure self-service portal for deploying infrastructure using Azure Verified Modules and Terraform. Features React frontend, Azure AD authentication, approval workflows, and comprehensive monitoring.`
- **Homepage**: `https://erdtree-portal-prod-68648.azurewebsites.net`
- **Visibility**: Public ✅
- **Initialize**: ❌ Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

### Step 2: Add Remote and Push

After creating the repository, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/erdtree-self-service.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Repository

Your repository should now contain:

```
